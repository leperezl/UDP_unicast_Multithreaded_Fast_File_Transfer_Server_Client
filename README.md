# UDP_unicast_Multithreaded_Fast_File_Transfer_Server_Client
This is a multithreaded UDP Server for send only functionality, however the thread and socket structures are a good base

To Start open server.py in console and provide the information required. Wait for the threads to create
Then open client.py and match the same number of clients with the server
wait for the files to get sent


Important notes. Files are fetched by the server from the Files Directory
Files are received inside the ArchivosRecibidos Directory

in command console for example, to enter the required path  .\Files\<your_file>.extension   (Windows)
                                                             ./Files/<your_file>.extension   (Linux)
